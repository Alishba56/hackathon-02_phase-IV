# PHR-2: Modern-Frontend-UI-Tasks

## Intent
Generate implementation tasks for the Modern & Best-in-Class Frontend UI feature based on the specification and implementation plan.

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive task breakdown organized by user stories with specific, actionable tasks following the checklist format. Tasks are organized in phases from setup through foundational components to user stories (authentication, task management, theme/accessibility, performance) and finally polish/cross-cutting concerns. Each task includes proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome & Impact
Successfully generated a detailed task breakdown that enables incremental and parallel development of the frontend UI. The tasks follow spec-driven development principles, organized by user stories to allow independent implementation and testing. This provides a clear roadmap for development with specific, actionable items.

## Test Results
none

## File Changes
- specs/001-modern-frontend-ui/tasks.md

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation following the task sequence
- Prioritize Phase 1 (Setup) and Phase 2 (Foundational) tasks first
- Work on User Story 1 (Authentication) as the MVP
- Track progress against individual tasks

## Reflection
The task breakdown effectively organizes the frontend development work by user stories, enabling teams to work on different features in parallel while maintaining clear dependencies and progression.
